### Module 1 Summary — Functions and Graphs

In this module, I practiced evaluating and comparing functions using algebraic, graphical, and verbal representations. I reinforced how to read information directly from graphs, including function values, intervals of increase/decrease, and domain and range.

I reviewed function notation and substitution, including evaluating functions at numeric and algebraic inputs, and distinguishing between expressions such as f(a²) and [f(a)]². I also worked with difference quotients involving radicals and practiced simplifying them using conjugates.

I strengthened my understanding of domain restrictions for rational and radical functions, paying attention to excluded values from denominators and boundary values allowed by square roots. I also practiced rewriting implicit equations as functions by solving for y and selecting appropriate branches (top or bottom halves of curves).

Overall, this module emphasized careful algebra, correct use of interval notation, and interpreting graphs accurately rather than relying on formulas alone.
