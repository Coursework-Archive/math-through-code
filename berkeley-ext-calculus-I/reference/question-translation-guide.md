## Chapter 1 

1. Evaluate $f(a), f(-2), f(a +1), 2f(a), f(2a), f(a+h)$
Replace x with whatever is inside the parenthesis, and simplify.

2. Does this equation define y as a function of x? 
For one x, is there exactly one y?

Translation rule: 
* If you can solve and get y = one expression -> yes
* If you get +/-, loops, sideways curves -> no

Key phrases to watch for:
"Define y as a function of x"

3. Find the domain
Which x-values are allowed?

Automatic triggers:
* Square roots -> inside >= 0
* Denominator -> not equal 0
* Logarithms -> inside > 0

Always an interval, not a list of exclusions

### Interval notation
Parenthesis () - NOT included
Used when:
* the endpoint is not allowed 
* the value would break the function 
example:
(2,5)
means:
$2 < x < 5$

Brackets [] -> included
Used when:
* the endpoint is allowed 
* the function works there 
example:
[2,5]
$2 <= x <= 5$

denominators and inside square roots must be >= 0
$\sqrt[x-3]$
x >= 3 => [3, inf)

$1 / x - 2$
x not equal 2 => (-inf,2) union (2, inf)

|Inequality| Interval |
|----------|----------|
| x > 3 | (3, inf) |
| x >= 3 | [3, inf) |
| x < 5 | (-inf, 5) |
| 2 <= 6 | [2, 6) |




4. Find the range
What y-values actually occur?

Domain = input 
Range = output 

5. Top half / bottom half
Choose the correct branch of +/-
* Top half -> +
* Bottom half -> -

You always get both algebraically - question tells you which one to keep

6. Even, odd, or neither
Is there symmetry

|Symmetry| Answer|
|--------|-------|
|y-axis| even|
|origin|odd|
|neither|neither|
