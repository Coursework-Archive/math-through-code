### Mistake: Overextending the domain of square root functions

I initially wrote domains using unions with infinity for functions involving square roots. For square root expressions, the domain is restricted to where the radicand is greater than or equal to zero, which usually results in a finite interval.

**Correction:**  
Solve the inequality inside the square root first, then write the domain directly from that solution. Do not include values outside the interval.

**Example:**  
For y = 2 + √(4 − x²), the domain is [-2, 2], not a union involving infinity.
