# 🧮 mitx-computational-thinking 
*MITx – “Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science”*
Why it fits: Focuses on modeling and algorithmic reasoning, with Python examples. 
If you want a deep, code-integrated mathematical course.

edX (Intermediate → Advanced)
Algorithms, simulation, optimization, probability modeling, and data-driven reasoning using Python + Jupyter.
9 weeks (6–8 hrs/week)
🔹 Mirrors your notebook-to-prod repo style.
🔹 Uses code-driven math with automation context (Monte Carlo, random seeds, optimization).
🔹 Great stepping stone for your math-through-code repo.

### 📘 Overview
This is my completion of the **MITx: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (6.00.2x)** course on [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science).  
It explores **simulation, probability, optimization, and data analysis** — all through executable code notebooks that connect theoretical concepts to real-world computation.
